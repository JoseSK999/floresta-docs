## UtreexoNode

`UtreexoNode` is the top-level type in Floresta, responsible for managing P2P connections, receiving network data, and broadcasting transactions. All its logic is found at the `floresta-wire` crate.

Blocks fetched by `UtreexoNode` are passed to a blockchain backend for validation and state tracking. This backend is represented by a generic `Chain` type. Additionally, `UtreexoNode` relies on a separate generic `Context` type to provide context-specific behavior. The default `Context` is `RunningNode`, which handles the transition between other contexts (it's the highest level context).

Below is the actual type definition, which is a struct with two fields and trait bounds for the `Chain` backend.

Filename: floresta-wire/src/p2p_wire/node.rs

```rust
# // Path: floresta-wire/src/p2p_wire/node.rs
#
pub struct UtreexoNode<Chain: ChainBackend, Context = RunningNode> {
    pub(crate) common: NodeCommon<Chain>,
    pub(crate) context: Context,
}
```

The `Chain` backend must implement the `ChainBackend` trait, which is just shorthand for the two key traits that define the backend.

```rust
# // Path: floresta-chain/src/pruned_utreexo/mod.rs
#
pub trait ChainBackend: BlockchainInterface + UpdatableChainstate {}
```

Each trait defines a distinct responsibility of our blockchain backend:

- `UpdatableChainstate`: Methods to update the state of the blockchain backend.
- `BlockchainInterface`: Defines the interface for interacting with other components, such as `UtreexoNode`.

Both traits are located in the `floresta-chain` library crate, in _src/pruned_utreexo/mod.rs_.

In the next section, we will explore the required API for these traits.
