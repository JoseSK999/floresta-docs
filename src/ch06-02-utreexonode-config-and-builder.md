## UtreexoNode Config and Builder

In this section and the next ones within this chapter, we are going to understand some methods implemented generically for `UtreexoNode`, that is, methods implemented for `UtreexoNode` under `T: NodeContext` rather than a specific context type.

While `ChainSelector`, `SyncNode`, and `RunningNode` provide `impl` blocks for `UtreexoNode`, those methods can only be used in a single context. Here, we will explore the functionality shared across all contexts.

### UtreexoNode Builder

Let's start with the builder function, taking a `UtreexoNodeConfig`, the `Chain` backend, a mempool type, optional compact block filters from the `floresta-compact-filters` crate, a kill signal to stop the node, and the address manager backend (that we will see [later in this chapter](ch06-04-address-manager.md)).

```rust
# // Path: floresta-wire/src/p2p_wire/node.rs
#
impl<T, Chain> UtreexoNode<Chain, T>
where
    T: 'static + Default + NodeContext,
    WireError: From<<Chain as BlockchainInterface>::Error>,
    Chain: BlockchainInterface + UpdatableChainstate + 'static,
{
    pub fn new(
        config: UtreexoNodeConfig,
        chain: Chain,
        mempool: Arc<Mutex<Mempool>>,
        block_filters: Option<Arc<NetworkFilters<FlatFiltersStore>>>,
        kill_signal: Arc<tokio::sync::RwLock<bool>>,
        address_man: AddressMan,
    ) -> Result<Self, WireError> {
        let (node_tx, node_rx) = unbounded_channel();
        let socks5 = config.proxy.map(Socks5StreamBuilder::new);

        let fixed_peer = config
            .fixed_peer
            .as_ref()
            .map(|address| {
                Self::resolve_connect_host(address, Self::get_port(config.network.into()))
            })
            .transpose()?;

        Ok(UtreexoNode {
            common: NodeCommon {
                // Initialization of many fields :P
                # block_sync_avg: FractionAvg::new(0, 0),
                # last_filter: chain.get_block_hash(0).unwrap(),
                # block_filters,
                # inflight: HashMap::new(),
                # inflight_user_requests: HashMap::new(),
                # peer_id_count: 0,
                # peers: HashMap::new(),
                # last_block_request: chain.get_validation_index().expect("Invalid chain"),
                # chain,
                # peer_ids: Vec::new(),
                # peer_by_service: HashMap::new(),
                # mempool,
                # network: config.network.into(),
                # node_rx,
                # node_tx,
                # address_man,
                # last_headers_request: Instant::now(),
                # last_tip_update: Instant::now(),
                # last_connection: Instant::now(),
                # last_peer_db_dump: Instant::now(),
                # last_broadcast: Instant::now(),
                # last_feeler: Instant::now(),
                # blocks: HashMap::new(),
                # last_get_address_request: Instant::now(),
                # last_send_addresses: Instant::now(),
                # datadir: config.datadir.clone(),
                # max_banscore: config.max_banscore,
                # socks5,
                # fixed_peer,
                # config,
                # kill_signal,
            },
            context: T::default(),
        })
    }
// ...
```

The `UtreexoNodeConfig` type outlines all the customizable options for running a `UtreexoNode`. It specifies essential settings like the network, connection preferences, and resource management options. It also has a `UtreexoNodeConfig::default` implementation. This type is better explained below.

Then, the `Mempool` type that we see in the signature is a very simple mempool implementation for broadcasting transactions to the network.

The first line creates an unbounded **multi-producer, single-consumer** (mpsc) channel, allowing multiple tasks in the `UtreexoNode` to send messages (via the sender `node_tx`) to a central task that processes them (via the receiver `node_rx`). If you are not familiar with channels, there's [a section from the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-02-message-passing.html) that covers them. Here, we use `tokio` channels instead of Rust's standard library channels.

> The `unbounded_channel` has no backpressure, meaning producers can keep sending messages without being slowed down, even if the receiver is behind. While this is convenient, it comes with the risk of excessive memory use if messages accumulate faster than they are processed.

The second line sets up a SOCKS5 proxy connection if a proxy address (`config.proxy`) is provided. SOCKS5 is a protocol that routes network traffic through a proxy server, useful for privacy or bypassing network restrictions. The `Socks5StreamBuilder` is a wrapper for `core::net::SocketAddr`, implemented in _p2p_wire/socks.rs_. If no proxy is configured, the node will connect directly to the network.

```rust
# // Path: floresta-wire/src/p2p_wire/socks.rs
#
impl Socks5StreamBuilder {
    pub fn new(address: SocketAddr) -> Self {
        Self { address }
    }
    // ...
```

Thirdly, we take the `config.fixed_peer`, which is an `Option<String>`, and convert it into an `Option<LocalAddress>` by using the `UtreexoNode::resolve_connect_host` function. `LocalAddress` is the local representation of a peer address in Floresta, which we will explore in the [Address Manager](ch06-04-address-manager.md) section.

Finally, the function returns the `UtreexoNode` with all the `NodeCommon` fields initialized and the default value of the passed `NodeContext`.

### UtreexoNodeConfig

Let's now check what are the customizable options for the node, that is, the `UtreexoNodeConfig` struct.

It starts with the `network` field (i.e. `Bitcoin`, `Testnet`, `Regtest` or `Signet`). Next we find the key options to enable `pow_fraud_proofs` for a very fast node sync, which we learned about in the [PoW Fraud Proofs Sync](ch05-00-advanced-chain-validation-methods.md#pow-fraud-proofs-sync) section from last chapter, and `compact_filters` for lightweight blockchain rescans.

A fixed peer can be specified via `fixed_peer`, and settings like `max_banscore`, `max_outbound`, and `max_inflight` allow fine-tuning of peer management, connection limits, and parallel requests.

Filename: p2p_wire/mod.rs

```rust

    # /// The blockchain we are in, defaults to Bitcoin. Possible values are Bitcoin,

    pub max_outbound: u32,
    /// Maximum number of inflight requests. Defaults to 10.
    ///
    /// More inflight requests means more memory usage, but also more parallelism.
    pub max_inflight: u32,
    // ...
    # /// Data directory for the node. Defaults to `.floresta-node`.
    # pub datadir: String,
    # /// A SOCKS5 proxy to use. Defaults to None.
    # pub proxy: Option<SocketAddr>,

    # pub user_agent: String,
    # /// Whether to allow fallback to v1 transport if v2 connection fails.
    # /// Defaults to true.
    # pub allow_v1_fallback: bool,
# }
#
# impl Default for UtreexoNodeConfig {
    # fn default() -> Self {
        # UtreexoNodeConfig {
            # network: Network::Bitcoin,
            # pow_fraud_proofs: false,
            # compact_filters: false,
            # fixed_peer: None,

            # filter_start_height: None,

            # allow_v1_fallback: true,
        # }
    # }
# }
```

Additional configurations include `datadir` for specifying the node's data directory and an optional `proxy` for connecting through a SOCKS5 proxy. Then we see the `assume_utreexo` option, which we also explained in the [Trusted UTXO Set Snapshots](ch05-00-advanced-chain-validation-methods.md#trusted-utxo-set-snapshots) section from last chapter.

    pub allow_v1_fallback: bool,
}
#
# impl Default for UtreexoNodeConfig {
    # fn default() -> Self {
        # UtreexoNodeConfig {
            # network: Network::Bitcoin,
            # pow_fraud_proofs: false,
            # compact_filters: false,
            # fixed_peer: None,
            # max_banscore: 100,
            # max_outbound: 8,
            # max_inflight: 10,
            # datadir: ".floresta-node".to_string(),
            # proxy: None,
            # backfill: false,
            # assume_utreexo: None,
            # filter_start_height: None,
            # user_agent: format!("floresta:{}", env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")),
            # allow_v1_fallback: true,
        # }
    # }
# }
```

If one of `pow_fraud_proofs` or `assume_utreexo` is set, the `backfill` option enables background and full validation of the chain, which is recommended for security since the node skipped the IBD.

For block filters, `filter_start_height` helps optimize downloads by starting from a specific height rather than the chain’s beginning. In relation to networking, `user_agent` allows nodes to customize their identifier when advertising to peers.

Lastly, `allow_v1_fallback` is used for specifying if our node should use the version 1 P2P transport protocol as a fallback if we encounter a problem when connecting via the [version 2 transport](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki).

This flexible configuration ensures adaptability for various use cases and security levels, from development to production.
