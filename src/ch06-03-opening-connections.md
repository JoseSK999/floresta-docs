## Opening Connections

In this section we are finally going to understand how Floresta connects to peers. The highest-level method for opening connections is `maybe_open_connection`, which will redirect us to other lower-level functionality. Remember that these methods are context-independent.

### When to Open Connections

The `maybe_open_connection` method determines whether the node should establish a new connection to a peer and, if so, calls `create_connection`.

```rust
# // Path: floresta-wire/src/p2p_wire/node.rs
#
pub(crate) async fn maybe_open_connection(
    &mut self,
    required_service: ServiceFlags,
) -> Result<(), WireError> {
    // If the user passes in a `--connect` cli argument, we only connect with
    // that particular peer.
    if self.fixed_peer.is_some() && !self.peers.is_empty() {
        return Ok(());
    }

    // If we've tried getting some connections, but the addresses we have are not
    // working. Try getting some more addresses from DNS
    self.maybe_ask_for_dns_peers();
    self.maybe_use_hadcoded_addresses();

    // Try to connect with manually added peers
    self.maybe_open_connection_with_added_peers().await?;

    let connection_kind = ConnectionKind::Regular(required_service);
    if self.peers.len() < T::MAX_OUTGOING_PEERS {
        self.create_connection(connection_kind).await?;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

If the user has specified a fixed peer via the `--connect` command-line argument (`self.fixed_peer.is_some()`) and there are already connected peers (`!self.peers.is_empty()`), the method does nothing and exits early. This is because we have already connected to the fixed peer.

Also, if the number of peers is below the maximum allowed (`self.peers.len() < T::MAX_OUTGOING_PEERS`), it calls the `create_connection` method to establish a new 'regular' connection to a peer.

The `ConnectionKind` struct that `create_connection` takes as argument is explained below.

### Connection Kinds

```rust
# // Path: floresta-wire/src/p2p_wire/node.rs
#
pub enum ConnectionKind {
    Feeler,
    // bitcoin::p2p::ServiceFlags
    Regular(ServiceFlags),
    Extra,
}
```

#### Feeler Connections
Feeler connections are temporary probes used to verify if a peer is still active, regardless of its supported services. These lightweight tests help maintain an up-to-date and reliable pool of peers, ensuring the node can quickly establish connections when needed.

#### Regular Connections
Regular connections are the backbone of a node's peer-to-peer communication. These connections are established with trusted peers or those that meet specific service criteria (e.g., support for Utreexo or compact filters). Regular connections are long-lived and handle the bulk of the node's operations, such as exchanging blocks, headers, transactions, and keeping the node in sync.

#### Extra Connections
Extra connections extend the node’s reach by connecting to additional peers for specialized tasks, such as compact filter requests or fetching Utreexo proofs. These are temporary and created only when extra resources are required.

### Create Connection

`create_connection` takes the required services for the connection kind, gets a peer address (prioritizing the fixed peer if specified), and ensures the peer isn’t already connected.

If no fixed peer is specified, we get a suitable peer address (or `LocalAddress`) for connection by calling `self.address_man.get_address_to_connect`. This method takes the required services and a boolean indicating whether a feeler connection is desired. We will explore this method in the next section.

```rust
# // Path: floresta-wire/src/p2p_wire/node.rs
#
pub(crate) async fn create_connection(
    &mut self,
    kind: ConnectionKind,
) -> Result<(), WireError> {
    let required_services = match kind {
        ConnectionKind::Feeler => ServiceFlags::NONE,
        ConnectionKind::Regular(services) => services,
        ConnectionKind::Extra => ServiceFlags::NONE,
    };

    let (peer_id, address) = self
        .fixed_peer
        .as_ref()
        .map(|addr| (0, addr.clone()))
        .or_else(|| {
            self.address_man.get_address_to_connect(
                required_services,
                matches!(kind, ConnectionKind::Feeler),
            )
        })
        .ok_or(WireError::NoAddressesAvailable)?;

    # debug!("attempting connection with address={address:?} kind={kind:?}",);
    #
    let now = SystemTime::now()
        .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)
        .unwrap()
        .as_secs();

    // Defaults to failed, if the connection is successful, we'll update the state
    self.address_man
        .update_set_state(peer_id, AddressState::Failed(now));

    // Don't connect to the same peer twice
    let is_connected = |(_, peer_addr): (_, &LocalPeerView)| {
        peer_addr.address == address.get_net_address() && peer_addr.port == address.get_port()
    };

    if self.common.peers.iter().any(is_connected) {
        return Err(WireError::PeerAlreadyExists(
            address.get_net_address(),
            address.get_port(),
        ));
    }

    // We allow V1 fallback only if the cli option was set, it's a --connect peer
    // or if we are connecting to a utreexo peer, since utreexod doesn't support V2 yet.
    let is_fixed = self.fixed_peer.is_some();
    let allow_v1 = self.config.allow_v1_fallback
        || kind == ConnectionKind::Regular(UTREEXO.into())
        || is_fixed;

    self.open_connection(kind, peer_id, address, allow_v1)
        .await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

Then we use the obtained `LocalAddress` and the peer identifier as arguments for `open_connection`, as well as the connection kind and whether we should fall back to the V1 P2P protocol if the V2 handshake fails.

Both the `LocalAddress` type and the `get_address_to_connect` method are implemented in the address manager module (_p2p_wire/address_man.rs_) that we will see in the next section.

### Open Connection

Moving on to `open_connection`, we create a new `unbounded_channel` for sending requests to the `Peer` instance. Recall that the `Peer` component is in charge of actually connecting to the respective peer over the network.

Then, depending on the value of `self.socks5` we will call `UtreexoNode::open_proxy_connection` or `UtreexoNode::open_non_proxy_connection`. Each one of these functions will create a `Peer` instance with the provided data and the channel receiver.

```rust
# // Path: floresta-wire/src/p2p_wire/node.rs
#
pub(crate) async fn open_connection(
    &mut self,
    kind: ConnectionKind,
    peer_id: usize,
    address: LocalAddress,
    allow_v1_fallback: bool,
) -> Result<(), WireError> {
    let (requests_tx, requests_rx) = unbounded_channel();
    if let Some(ref proxy) = self.socks5 {
        spawn(timeout(
            Duration::from_secs(10),
            Self::open_proxy_connection(
                // Arguments omitted for brevity :P
                # proxy.address,
                # kind,
                # self.mempool.clone(),
                # self.network,
                # self.node_tx.clone(),
                # peer_id,
                # address.clone(),
                # requests_rx,
                # self.peer_id_count,
                # self.config.user_agent.clone(),
                # allow_v1_fallback,
            ),
        ));
    } else {
        spawn(timeout(
            Duration::from_secs(10),
            Self::open_non_proxy_connection(
                // Arguments omitted for brevity :P
                # kind,
                # peer_id,
                # address.clone(),
                # requests_rx,
                # self.peer_id_count,
                # self.mempool.clone(),
                # self.network,
                # self.node_tx.clone(),
                # self.config.user_agent.clone(),
                # allow_v1_fallback,
            ),
        ));
    }

    let peer_count: u32 = self.peer_id_count;

    self.inflight.insert(
        InflightRequests::Connect(peer_count),
        (peer_count, Instant::now()),
    );

    self.peers.insert(
        peer_count,
        LocalPeerView {
            // Fields omitted for brevity :P
            # address: address.get_net_address(),
            # port: address.get_port(),
            # user_agent: "".to_string(),
            # state: PeerStatus::Awaiting,
            # channel: requests_tx,
            # services: ServiceFlags::NONE,
            # _last_message: Instant::now(),
            # kind,
            # address_id: peer_id as u32,
            # height: 0,
            # banscore: 0,
            # // Will be downgraded to V1 if the V2 handshake fails, and we allow fallback
            # transport_protocol: TransportProtocol::V2,
        },
    );

    self.peer_id_count += 1;

    Ok(())
}
```

Last of all, we simply insert the new inflight request (via the `InflightRequests` type) to our tracker `HashMap`, as well as the new peer (via the `LocalPeerView`). Both types are also defined in _p2p_wire/node.rs_, along with `UtreexoNode`, `NodeCommon`, `ConnectionKind`, and a few other types.

### Recap

In this section, we have learned how Floresta establishes peer-to-peer connections, starting with the `maybe_open_connection` method. This method initiates a connection if we aren't already connected to the optional fixed peer and either have fewer connections than `Context::MAX_OUTGOING_PEERS` or lack a peer offering utreexo services.

We explored the three connection types: `Feeler` (peer availability check), `Regular` (core communication), and `Extra` (specialized services). The `create_connection` method selects an appropriate peer address while preventing duplicate connections, and `open_connection` handles the network setup, either via a proxy or directly (internally creating a new `Peer`). Finally, we examined how new connections are tracked using inflight requests and a peer registry, both fields of `NodeCommon`.
